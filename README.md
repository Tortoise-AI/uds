**A vendor-neutral, declarative format for AI-native analytical dashboards**

---

## What is UDS?

Modern organizations face a fundamental problem with their analytical dashboards: they're locked into proprietary platforms, impossible to version control, and can't be generated by AI at scale. Each vendor uses its own format, dashboards are defined through point-and-click interfaces, and migrating between platforms requires complete rebuilds.

The Universal Dashboard Specification (UDS) solves this by providing a vendor-neutral, declarative format for describing analytical dashboards. Think of it as "the Kubernetes of dashboards" — a specification layer that sits above any rendering platform.

UDS enables:

- **Semantic-first design**: Dashboards reference metrics and dimensions from your existing semantic layer (Cube, dbt Semantic Layer, Looker, etc.) rather than hard-coding SQL
- **Intent-driven declaration**: Every dashboard explicitly declares its purpose, the decisions it enables, and who it serves
- **AI-powered generation**: Built from the ground up for AI assistants to generate dashboards with constraints, confidence scores, and human review workflows
- **True portability**: Write once, compile to Grafana, Metabase, or custom renderers
- **Version control native**: Dashboards are YAML files that live in git alongside your application code
- **Persona awareness**: Dashboards adapt their complexity, metrics, and visualizations to executives, managers, analysts, operators, or external users

UDS is not a rendering engine. It's a specification that owns the abstraction layer while letting you choose your rendering platform. This creates a sustainable ecosystem where tooling vendors can build parsers, renderers, and AI agents without platform lock-in.

## Key Features

- **Semantic-first**: References metrics/dimensions from semantic layer (Cube, dbt, Looker, etc.) instead of raw SQL
- **Intent-driven**: Every dashboard declares its purpose and the decisions it enables
- **Persona-aware**: Adapts to executive, manager, analyst, operator, and external user personas
- **AI-native**: Designed for generation with constraints, confidence scores, and human review
- **Portable**: Compile to Grafana, Metabase, Looker, or custom renderers
- **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant by design with screen reader support
- **Extensible**: Layered conformance (Core/Standard/Complete) allows gradual adoption
- **Version control friendly**: Plain YAML that works with git, CI/CD, and code review

## Quick Example

Here's a minimal UDS dashboard that shows daily revenue:

```yaml
uds: "0.1.0"

dashboard:
  title: "Sales Overview"
  intent: "Monitor daily sales performance and identify revenue trends"
  persona:
    type: manager
    customization_level: moderate

  semantic_sources:
    - id: sales
      type: cube
      endpoint: "https://cube.example.com/cubejs-api/v1"
      auth:
        type: bearer
        token_env: "CUBE_API_TOKEN"

  layout:
    type: grid
    columns: 12
    row_height: 60

  panels:
    - id: revenue
      type: kpi
      title: "Total Revenue"
      position:
        row: 0
        column: 0
        width: 4
        height: 2
      data:
        source: sales
        metrics:
          - ref: "sales.total_revenue"
        time_range:
          type: relative
          value: "today"
      formatting:
        number_format:
          style: currency
          currency: USD
```

This dashboard:
- Declares its intent (monitoring sales performance)
- Specifies it's for a manager persona
- References metrics from a Cube semantic layer
- Uses a responsive grid layout
- Includes a single KPI panel with currency formatting

## Documentation

- **[Specification](./specification/uds-specification-0.1.0.md)**: Complete UDS v0.1.0 specification
- **Examples**: See the [examples/](./examples/) directory for sample dashboards
- **JSON Schema**: Coming in Phase 3
- **Tooling**: Reference parser and renderer coming in Phases 4-5

## Project Status

**Current Version**: v0.1.0 (Draft)

### Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: ✅ Specification complete (v0.1.0)
- **Phase 2**: Examples and sample dashboards (in progress)
- **Phase 3**: JSON Schema for validation
- **Phase 4**: Reference parser (TypeScript)
- **Phase 5**: Reference renderer (React)
- **Phase 6**: Conformance test suite
- **Phase 7**: Documentation site
- **Phase 8**: Public launch and community building

## Related Projects

Future ecosystem projects (coming soon):

- `uds-parser`: Reference TypeScript parser for UDS documents
- `uds-renderer`: React-based reference renderer
- `uds-validator`: JSON Schema validator and conformance checker
- `uds-ai-agent`: AI assistant for generating UDS dashboards
- `uds-compiler-grafana`: Grafana JSON compiler
- `uds-compiler-metabase`: Metabase API compiler

## Use Cases

UDS is designed for:

- **AI-powered dashboard generation**: LLMs generate dashboards from natural language with built-in constraints and review
- **Platform migration**: Move dashboards between Grafana, Metabase, Looker, or custom platforms
- **Version control and CI/CD**: Store dashboards in git, review changes, and deploy via pipelines
- **Multi-tenant analytics**: Generate personalized dashboards for different user personas
- **Semantic layer adoption**: Decouple dashboards from raw SQL and reference your semantic layer
- **Compliance and governance**: Enforce data access policies, accessibility standards, and documentation requirements
